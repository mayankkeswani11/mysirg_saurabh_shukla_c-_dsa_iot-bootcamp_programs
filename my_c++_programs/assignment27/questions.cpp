/*Assignment - 27 A Job Ready Bootcamp in C++, DSA and IOT MySirG
Operator overloading and friend function
1. Define a class Complex with appropriate instance variables and member functions.
Define following operators in the class:
a. +
b. -
c. *
d. ==
2. Write a C++ program to overload unary operators that is increment and decrement.
3. Write a C++ program to add two complex numbers using operator overloaded by a
friend function.
4. Create a class Time which contains:
- Hours
- Minutes
- Seconds
Write a C++ program using operator overloading for the following:
1. = = : To check whether two Times are the same or not.
2. >> : To accept the time.
3. << : To display the time.
Output -
5. Consider following class Numbers
class Numbers
{
int x,y,z;
public:
// methods
};
Overload the operator unary minus (-) to negate the numbers.
6. Create a class CString to represent a string.
a) Overload the + operator to concatenate two strings.
b) == to compare 2 strings.
7. Define a C++ class fraction
class fraction
{
long numerator;
long denominator;
Public:
fraction (long n=0, long d=0);
}
Overload the following operators as member or friend:
a) Unary ++ (pre and post both)
b) Overload as friend functions: operators << and >>.
Output-
8. Consider a class Matrix
Class Matrix
{
int a[3][3];
Public:
//methods;
};
Overload the - (Unary) should negate the numbers stored in the object.
Output -
9. Consider the following class mystring
Class mystring
{
char str [100];
Public:
// methods
};
Overload operator “!” to reverse the case of each alphabet in the string
(Uppercase to Lowercase and vice versa).
10.Class Matrix
{
int a[3][3];
Public:
//methods;
};
Let m1 and m2 are two matrices. Find out m3=m1+m2 (use operator
overloading).
